# ADK Answering Agent

The ADK Answering Agent is a Python-based agent designed to help answer questions in GitHub discussions for the `google/adk-python` repository. It uses a large language model to analyze open discussions, retrieve information from document store, generate response, and post a comment in the github discussion.

This agent can be operated in three distinct modes:

- An interactive mode for local use.
- A batch script mode for oncall use.
- A fully automated GitHub Actions workflow.

---

## Interactive Mode

This mode allows you to run the agent locally to review its recommendations in real-time before any changes are made to your repository's issues.

### Features
* **Web Interface**: The agent's interactive mode can be rendered in a web browser using the ADK's `adk web` command.
* **User Approval**: In interactive mode, the agent is instructed to ask for your confirmation before posting a comment to a GitHub issue.
* **Question & Answer**: You can ask ADK related questions, and the agent will provide answers based on its knowledge on ADK.

### Running in Interactive Mode
To run the agent in interactive mode, first set the required environment variables. Then, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
adk web
```
This will start a local server and provide a URL to access the agent's web interface in your browser.

---

## Batch Script Mode

The `main.py` script supports batch processing for ADK oncall team to process discussions.

### Features
* **Single Discussion**: Process a specific discussion by providing its number.
* **Batch Process**: Process the N most recently updated discussions.
* **Direct Discussion Data**: Process a discussion using JSON data directly (optimized for GitHub Actions).

### Running in Batch Script Mode
To run the agent in batch script mode, first set the required environment variables. Then, execute one of the following commands:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=contributing/samples

# Answer a specific discussion
python -m adk_answering_agent.main --discussion_number 27

# Answer the 10 most recent updated discussions
python -m adk_answering_agent.main --recent 10

# Answer a discussion using direct JSON data (saves API calls)
python -m adk_answering_agent.main --discussion '{"number": 27, "title": "How to...", "body": "I need help with...", "author": {"login": "username"}}'
```

---

## GitHub Workflow Mode

The `main.py` script is automatically triggered by GitHub Actions when new discussions are created in the Q&A category. The workflow is configured in `.github/workflows/discussion_answering.yml` and automatically processes discussions using the `--discussion` flag with JSON data from the GitHub event payload.

### Optimization
The GitHub Actions workflow passes discussion data directly from `github.event.discussion` using `toJson()`, eliminating the need for additional API calls to fetch discussion information that's already available in the event payload. This makes the workflow faster and more reliable.

## Update the Knowledge Base

The `upload_docs_to_vertex_ai_search.py` is a script to upload ADK related docs to Vertex AI Search datastore to update the knowledge base. It can be executed with the following command in your terminal:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=contributing/samples # If not already exported
python -m adk_answering_agent.upload_docs_to_vertex_ai_search
```

## Setup and Configuration

Whether running in interactive or workflow mode, the agent requires the following setup.

### Dependencies
The agent requires the following Python libraries.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install google-adk
```

The agent also requires gcloud login:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

The upload script requires the following additional Python libraries.

```bash
pip install google-cloud-storage google-cloud-discoveryengine
```

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required for the agent to connect to the necessary services.

* `GITHUB_TOKEN=YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN`: **(Required)** A GitHub Personal Access Token with `issues:write` permissions. Needed for both interactive and workflow modes.
* `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE`: **(Required)** Use Google Vertex AI for the authentication.
* `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT_ID`: **(Required)** The Google Cloud project ID.
* `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=LOCATION`: **(Required)** The Google Cloud region.
* `VERTEXAI_DATASTORE_ID=YOUR_DATASTORE_ID`: **(Required)** The full Vertex AI datastore ID for the document store (i.e. knowledge base), with the format of `projects/{project_number}/locations/{location}/collections/{collection}/dataStores/{datastore_id}`.
* `OWNER`: The GitHub organization or username that owns the repository (e.g., `google`). Needed for both modes.
* `REPO`: The name of the GitHub repository (e.g., `adk-python`). Needed for both modes.
* `INTERACTIVE`: Controls the agent's interaction mode. For the automated workflow, this is set to `0`. For interactive mode, it should be set to `1` or left unset.

The following environment variables are required to upload the docs to update the knowledge base.

* `GCS_BUCKET_NAME=YOUR_GCS_BUCKET_NAME`: **(Required)** The name of the GCS bucket to store the documents.
* `ADK_DOCS_ROOT_PATH=YOUR_ADK_DOCS_ROOT_PATH`: **(Required)** Path to the root of the downloaded adk-docs repo.
* `ADK_PYTHON_ROOT_PATH=YOUR_ADK_PYTHON_ROOT_PATH`: **(Required)** Path to the root of the downloaded adk-python repo.

For local execution in interactive mode, you can place these variables in a `.env` file in the project's root directory. For the GitHub workflow, they should be configured as repository secrets.
